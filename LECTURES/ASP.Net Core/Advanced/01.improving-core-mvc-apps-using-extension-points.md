# Improving .NET Core MVC Apps Using Extension Points

## Introducing Resource, Type, and Service Filters

- Type and Service Filters provide other filters with Dependency Injection
-- Used with Filters that deal with Dependency Injection

- The problems with Filter Creation
-- No Constructor method on Attribute Filters
-- Type/Service Filters eliminate the notion to inherit from an Filter

```<c#>
[TypeFilter(typeof(FeatureFilter))]
public class FeatureTypeFilter

```

- Type Filters
-- Create filter dependencies using MVC Dependency Resolver
- Service Filters
-- Create both the filter and its dependencies using MVC Dependency Resolver
