# Exploring The Application Middleware

- Middleware is like an assembly line process that is bi-directional
-- Works in a step-by-step processing pipeline
-- Same idea in ASP.Net Core
--- Processes Http Methods
---- Logger
---- Authorizer
---- Router

- HTTP Request => POST/corn
-- Logger
-- Authorizer => if OK, then move on to the next step
-- Router => Router looks for some controller with corn
-- Response => returns response

- Middleware process is bi-directional
-- Gets a response and does a reply

## Configure Method

- Check if in Development Environment
-- env.IsDevelopment()
--- app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage()
-- app.UseHttpsRedirection()
-- app.UseStaticFiles()
-- app.UseNodeModules(env)
-- app.UseCookiePolicy()
-- app.UseCors()
-- If in Production
--- app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error")
--- app.UseHsts() => instructs the browser to only access the information on a secure Https
--- Use in conjunction with app.UseHttpsRedirection()

- The order of the middleware is important
-- When a particular step fails, the other steps later in the pipeline won't execute

- SignalR => used for realtime Web Socket communication
