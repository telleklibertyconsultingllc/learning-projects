# ASP.Net MVC Request Life Cycle

## Benefits of Understanding MVC

- Debugging
- Customization
- Architecture => Structuring more thoroughly
- Understanding a framework's processing pipeline improves a developer

## Defining the Request Life Cycles

- Request Life Cycle => high-level state a request passes through

## The MVC Request Life Cycle

- Request life cycle are build upon a technology name middleware
- Request Life Cycle
-- Middleware => Building blocks of HTTP pipeline
-- Routing => Endpint routing middleware
-- Controller Initialization => controller factory or controller action invoker
-- Action Method Execution => Model binding, action filters, action execution, action filters, action result
-- Action Result Execution => Result filters, invoke action result
-- View Engine (if not RESTFul API) => If there's a view, will find and render the view

## Understanding the Middleware Pipeline

- What is Middleware?
-- Conceptually => The series of components that form the application request pipeline.
-- Provides all kinds of foundational frameworks
--- Routing
--- Session
--- CORS
--- Authentication
--- Caching
- You can add as many middleware you want, there order is very important!
-- Static Files Middleware
-- Authentication Middleware
-- Routing Middleware (MVC Integration)
- Coding Middleware
-- Middleware Configuration Options
--- Generate a response => Run()
--- Perform work on the request => Use()
--- Reroute the request => Map()
- Startup Class
-- Allows us to configure Middleware Components

## Introducing Endpoint Routing

- Endpoint Routing Middleware
-- Decides which Endpoint should handle the request
- Endpoint Middleware
-- Executes the selected Endpoint to generate a response later in the pipeline

## Understanding the MVC Request Pipeline

- Http Request
-- Static Files Middleware
-- Endpoint Routing Middleware
--- Routes
--- Endpoints
-- Authorization Middleware
-- Endpoint Middleware
-- MVC Framework
