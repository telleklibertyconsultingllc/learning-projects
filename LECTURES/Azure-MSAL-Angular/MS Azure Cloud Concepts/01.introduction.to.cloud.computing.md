# An introduction to Cloud Computing

- History of the start of cloud computing
-- Data Centers
-- Virtualization
--- High up-front cost
--- Space needed to host servers
--- Electricity/utility costs
--- Hardware maintenance still needed

## Cloud Computing

- enables companies to consume a compute resource, such as a virtual machine, storage, or an application, as a utility -- just like electricity -- rather than having to build and maintain computing infrastructures in-house
-- Cloud Provider - company that have shared resources over the internet
-- Cloud Infrastructure (On-demand Self Service) - clients decide what services to provide

## How Much does the public cloud cost?

- Services are billed on-demand, by the minute or by the hour
- Allows organizations to create new resources when needed, and shut them off (and stop paying) when they are not needed anymore
- Organizations can be more dynamic and cost-effective
- Reduces up-front cost
-- Cost goes into Operating Expenses (OpEx) instead of Capital Expenses (CapEx)
--- Capital expenditures are depreciated over the useful life of the asset
---- You cannot fully deduct the cost from the fiscal year the asset was paid for in
--- Operating Expenses are deducted in the same year they are made
