# Understanding Azure Subscriptions

- Understand Azure Subscriptions
-- Adopting Azure starts with creating a new subscription, tying it to an account, and then deploying the cloud resources you will consume
-- Subscription
--- Resource Group (group resources that share a lifecycle)
---- Resource (database, virtual machine or kubernetes cluster is deployed in a resource group and is associated with a subscription)
- An Azure account is used for contact information and billing details for an Azure subscription.
- An Azure subscription is a logical container and grouping of Azure resources and administration
- Azure Subscription Elements
-- Legal agreement
-- A billing unit
-- Logical boundary of scale
-- First container created and administrative boundary

- Management Groups
-- Allow you to apply governance conditions (access and policies) a level of scope above subscriptions
- Container Hierarchy
-- Management Group
--- Subscriptions
---- Resource Group
----- Resources

- Understanding the Factors Affecting Costs
-- Location: Azure is global with regions all over the world. Costs can vary between regions for the same Azure products, services, and resources. This is based on factors such as level of popularity.
-- Service: Azure usage rates and billing periods can be different across Enterprise Agreements, Direct & CSP, which affect costs
-- Egress traffic: Sending data into Azure ingress (inbound) is always free. However, pulling data out of Azure egress (outbound) always has a cost. Understanding traffic flow and egress charges on services that will be consumed will help estimate costs.
-- Resource Type: Costs are specific to each resource. The usage that a meter tracks and the amount of meters associated to a resource will depend on resource type.

- Understanding Zones for Billing Purposes
-- Zone 1: United States, US Government, Europe, Canada, UK, France, Switzerland
-- Zone 2: East Asia, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, India, Korea
-- Zone 3: Brazil, South Africa, UAE
-- DE Zone 1: Germany
