16 Laws of Psychological Power
01. Stand alone or stand out
02. Hide your intentions and keep your true intentions to yourself
03. Actions over arguments
04. Mind your words - most important laws of psychological power (speak less and stop yourself from making clumsy mistake). Make promises can't keep. 
05. Cultivate Confidence - obstacle, failure and setbacks. People who give up starve themselves of psychological power
06. Hire your enemies - find the loyalty of people you don't trust
07. People are selfish - people can help when they have something to gain
08. Avoid commitment - avoid unnecessary promises. Always commit to yourself
09. Play yourself down - play dumb means you have nothing to prove.
10. Support your superiors - if you want to climb their ladder, you need to respect the ladder
11. Stay Concentrated - don't just identify your strengths, develop them. Don't spread yourself too thin.
12. Effortless Achievement - play down your achievements even if you invested thousand hours of work.
13. The giant shadow - don't fill the shoes of a legend. Portray a failure and when you succeed, you will shine
14. Set anger aside - ambivalence (when you ignore someone, you get their attention). Keep your frustration to yourself
15. The calm rush - master time and time management. Don't let your busy days get the best of you. Rushing is a recipe for disaster
16. Calculated Value - you need to spend money when it counts
