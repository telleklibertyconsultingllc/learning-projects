PBIs Process (Deliver everything requested in the PBI)
1. List required functionalities for the UI
2. Determine all UI components, directives, pipes, services, stores (if needed) for the wireframe
3. Pick existing UI and see styles where wireframes are referring to - for reusability
4. Pick existing components, directives, pipes, services, stores where wireframes are referring to - for reusability
5. Determine code changes
6. Implement Code 
7. Make sure implementation functions according to step 1
8. Check for errors in the component
9. Check styling against wireframes
10. Perform integration and system testing - watch console window in the developer's console to see if any errors exist
11. Revisit PBI and see if anything has changed from what was listed in step 1
12. Repeat steps 2 to 10, if anything has changed
13. Deploy to DEV and verify against PBI
14. Remember to do Regression Testing after every defect fix and implementation of a PBI

NOTES
-	WIREFRAME: If any discrepancy between wireframe and BDD, always use wireframe as the base. If wireframe has a problem, then notify Jonathan Healy.
-	PROPOSAL â€“ Should in case PBI is partially ready in mid-sprint, ask to create new PBI with new functionality
