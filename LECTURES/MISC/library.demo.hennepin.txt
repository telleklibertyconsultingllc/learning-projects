ECF Shared Library DEMO
- Overview of libraries in Angular
-- Purposes
--- 1. Used for resuable code in multiple applications
---- Can be used for multiple Angular applications
---- Can be used for multiple Angular and other JavaScript Framework Applications (like React, .etc)
--- 2. Custom - can be used for a single application, but, you have a lot of teams developing features on a single angular application

- Creating a Library
-- 1. Recommendation by Angular - Definition used by Angular
--- Single Angular Application with multiple projects
--- Modularize or Composite Applications (similar like Managed Extension Framework (MEF), PRISM, UNITY in .Net Applications)
-- 2. Building Library as a stand alone

- Building a Library
-- Building a library

- Consuming a Library
-- Coding LifeCycle of a Library
--- Compiling
---- NPM Pack
---- Use the path with tsconfig
--- Debugging
---- Install NPM Pack in your application
---- Step through code
----- Step through Library Project with Visual Studio Code
----- Step through Library code using NPM Pack
--- Deploying to Environments
---- Recommendations
----- Establish your environments in NPM using Organziations/sub-organzation-folder
----- Handle installation in your package.json 
---- NPM 
----- Create a PRIVATE Account in NPM - Recommended => this will hide all your libraries from the public
----- Create Organizations for your libraries
----- using .npmrc for deploying configuring your Angular applications to install libraries on your local or in Azure DevOps
