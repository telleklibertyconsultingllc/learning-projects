1. Blueprint for your Foundation
-- Benchmark your performance with PageSpeed Insights
-- Iterate with Lighthouse via DevTools' Audits Panel
-- Track your field data with the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX) Dashboard
-- Understand key speed metrics
2. Techniques
3. Robust 

- A feature is only as good as how performant it is
-- How website owners typically deploy features:
--- Step 1: define purpose and target audience
--- Step 2: determine content
--- Step 3: select structure
--- Step 4: specify navigation system
--- Step 5: design the look and feel
--- Step 6: test, publish and maintain

- Performance is about solving business problems
- After understanding your performance problems, you must set performance budgets
-- Define a budget file (simple-budget.json)
[{
	"path": "/",
	"resourceSizes": [
		{
			"resourceType": "script",
			"budget": 125
		},
		{
			"resourceType": "stylesheet",
			"budget": 125
		}
	],
	"resourceCounts": [
		{
			"resourceType": "total",
			"budget": 35
		}
	]
}]
-- Use your budget in Lighthouse
