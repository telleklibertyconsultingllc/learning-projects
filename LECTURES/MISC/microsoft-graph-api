RE: ECF User Guide Opinion Needed
I’m interested in hearing what Harry has to say considering he will do most of the publishing. 

Dev – any concerns about any of these options? Or do we just need to pick one? 

Thanks,

Subject: ECF User Guide Opinion Needed

Greetings-
After meeting with the SharePoint team this morning, it sounds like we have 3 options for the ECF User Guide. I’ve listed them below along with my understanding of the risk/benefit for each.
Harry- I’m hoping you can add to the pros/cons of the Azure option and answer some of the questions included in the table.

“Regular” SharePoint Site	Teams SharePoint Site	Azure
Risk	Benefit	Risk	Benefit	Risk	Benefit
•	Need Enterprise approval to use Flare
•	If we want, style of site to match ECF Next, we would need to request an exception from Enterprise to deviate from the template
•	For search purposes, we would need to request another, separate site for the ECF User Guide. We cannot re-use the ECF Support site. (Unless Harry indicates Flare allows us to limit search to a specific library)	•	Known format/program
•	No change request required for updates
•	Would allow Harry to have someone as back up if needed.
•	We could possibly move forward without Flare, but we would lose functionality that Flare gives us.	•	By default, the SP site comes with a team. There is no way to limit the collaboration functionality of that team.
o	SCAs would need to set up SharePoint site access to everyone and we would need to limit access to the Team.
•	It seems the county has been changing “chat” tools often. How long Teams will be used is an unknown.	•	No existing governance.
•	No approval required to use Flare.
•	Team functionality could be used to communicate needed changes/plan & track progress.	•	Requires change request to update pages?
o	Why is unclear
o	Could push back against this more.
•	More questions:
o	Can Harry have a back-up?
o	Is there an associated cost?
o	What kind of governance exists in Azure?	•	Harry is already doing this for Stephanie Mitchell’s team?

Do any other developers need to be included in this email chain/discussion?
Any feedback, additions to the table, and/or questions are welcome.
