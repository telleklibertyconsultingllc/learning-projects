10 Successful Secrets from Bill Gates
- Don't compare yourself to anyone else in this world. You are unique.
- To win big, you sometimes have to take big risks
- Your exposure from a young age to the realities of the world is a super-big thing. Life is tough and noone will help you solve your problems.
- You need a coach. In life, you become the person you admire. If you don't admire someone you become noone. Look for someone to challenge
- If you show people the problems and you show people the solutions, they will be moved to act. Don't just give instructions
- Success is a lousy teacher. It can seduce you into thinking you can't lose. People who are successful for a long time learn a lot.
- I spend a lot of time reading. Life changes everyday and the only way to keep relevant is to read. The books you read is based on what you read and the books you read.
- We start life with many big dreams - things we want to accomplish, create, build and experience. But if you ask anyone past the age of 40 what happened to all the dreams, they will most likely say LIFE.
- Our success has really been based on partnerships from the beginning. Two are better than one.
- Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning
