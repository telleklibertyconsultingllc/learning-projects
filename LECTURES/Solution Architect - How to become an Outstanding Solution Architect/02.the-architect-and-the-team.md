# The Architect and the Team

In this section you're going to learn how the Solution Architect fits into an IT team. You will need this knowledge to become an outstanding architect.

We're going to take a close look at Software Team Roles: who does what an an IT team, and who reports to whom? We'll zoom in specifically on the roles of Functional Analyst, and Lead Developer, because these are the two individuals the Architect will spend the most time with.

Finally, we will take a close look at the Solution Architect. What is the role of the architect, how does he or she fit in the team, and what are his or her responsibilities to make the project run smoothly?

## We have looked at Team Roles, and learned that certain roles always show up in pretty much any organization. They are:

- Understand the business problem
- Document the functional business solution
- Create a technical architecture
- Convert the technical architecture to actual code
- Manage the development team
- Test the code
- Deploy the code

The Solution Architect sits at the heart of the project, with the Functional Analyst providing functional specifications to the architect, and the architect providing a technical architecture, leadership, and guidance to the Lead Developer.

## Software Team Roles

- people coming together to create a software system or suite of software systems to solve a particular business problem
- Typical Team Roles and responsibilities
-- Project Manager => Responsible for the planning of all milestones, dates when certain functionalities will be available, .etc
--- Solution Architect => talks to the Funcation Analyst and takes the inputs or requirements and comes up with a high-level technical specification; such as a diagram
---- Functional Analysts => Gathers requirements from user representatives and creates a functional requirement or specifications document
----- User Representative => end-users of the systems (primarily one or more users). Are going to convey their requirements
---- Lead Developer => leader of the developer team and responsible for coding and implementing the technical specification or architecture specification created by the Architect
----- Developer => number of developers that work for the Lead Developer
--- QA => Quality Assurance, responsible for testing the system (Smoke Testing, System Testing, Integration Testing, User-Acceptance Testing)
--- Deployment Manager => Responsible for Deployments of the product, nightly builds, .etc. Only deployment manager have credentials for production environments.
-- Trainer

-- Principles of Software Development
--- Implementation is different in each company
--- There are commonalities
--- Understand business problem
--- Document non-technical business solution
--- Convert solution to technical architecture
--- Manage developers
--- Test code
--- Deploy code

## Required Skills of a Good Solution Architect

- Understanding the Business objectives
- Cross-Domain Understanding => understand programming, quality assurance, functional analysts, leadership, .etc
- Multiple Perspectives or viewpoints
- People skills => to make communication go smoothly
- Lifelong learning => have to commit yourself to lifelong learning from technologies to other key stakeholders on the teams

### The Functional Analyst

- This is the person who talks to the user representative and creates the functional specifications. Sometimes referred to as Business Analyst or Product Owner.
- Responsible for functionality
- Captures, consolidates and communicates information
- Constantly asks questions:
-- What do you mean?
-- How does this fit in with...?
- Identifies and resolvess conflicts
- Produces requirements specification

- Skillset of the Functional Analyst are:
-- Conflict Management => conflicting information from user representatvies and other stakeholders
-- Communication skills => see things from other viewpoints. Understand the different types of viewpoints
-- Attention to Detail => hyper focus on details
-- Precise communicator
-- Know when detail is necessary and when not
-- Adept at dealing with differing opinions
-- Great relationship skills
-- Very good listeners
-- Can create clear and precise documents
-- Skilled in using Office tools
-- Don't constantly interjects.
-- Must listen; be very good listeners

- PROS
-- Key role; responsible for functionalities of the system
--- Talks to several stakeholders

- CONS
-- Has to work with bad user respresentative => don't know what they wnat
-- Can expect conflict
-- Will receive blame if functionality is missing

### The Lead Developer

- Connected to the Solution Architect and Developer
- He is the leader of the development team
-- Same as Team Lead Developer, Technical Lead Developer

- Responsibilites
-- Receives the architecture design of the Solution Architect and implement the system using this design
-- Split these implementation tasks and assign them to several developers

- Primary Responsibilities
-- Leads and Mentors other developers
-- Assign tasks to developers => junior developers get easier tasks and senior developers get tougher tasks
-- Details and partitions work => code review
-- Ensures that all developers are successful
--- Makes sure that the entire team is successful

- Skills of the Lead Developer
-- Mentoring skills => mentorship program with junior developers. Junior developers should be elavated; as well as, Senior Developers
-- Programming Skills
-- Values-Driven => really facinated by code and understands that elegance is a value in coding. Driven to incorporate these values in the entire team
--- Precision
--- Elegance
--- Reusability
--- Efficiency
-- Grows out of developer role
-- Requires great relationship with Architect
-- Wide knowledge of libraries/tools/techniques
-- Adept at creating technical specifications
-- Adept at build and configuration management => starts with Lead Developer and handed over to Deployment Manager
-- Adept at debugging, post-mortem log inspection, etc
-- Can create own tools if needed

- PROS
-- Lead-in to Solution Architect
-- Involves coding (optional)
-- Can pick and choose cool tasks

- CONS
-- Can get squeezed between Solution Architect and Developers
-- Lifelong learning required
-- Turns into Developers if the Project Manager is weak
-- Team might be too small
-- Vulnerable to offshoring

### The Solution Architect

- Basically wedged between the functional analyst and Project Manager
- Takes the requirements or specifications from the Functional Analyst and comes up with an Architectural Design
-- Shares the design with the Lead Developer
-- Have a really tight working relationship

- Responsibilities
-- Responsible for all the technology used to build the system. MASSIVE RESPONSIBILITY
-- Technology must be of high standard
-- Converts Functional Requirements to Technical Architecture
-- Carefully balances patterns/requirements/elegance/concepts
-- Researches Key Technologies
-- Has deep understanding of Design Patterns
-- Motivates and guides the development team in supporting your Architecture Design
-- Ensures that the Lead Developer is successful - VERY IMPORTANT!!

- Skills of the Solution Architect (THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO BE)
-- Functional Understanding
-- Technical Knowledge
-- Leadership skills
-- Grows out of Lead Developer role
-- Requires great relationship with Lead Developer
- Helicopter view at all times or have a holistic view of the system
- Deep understanding of Design Patterns
- Fluent in UML and other design tools
- Experience with tools and Code Generators

- PRO
-- Super high value postion
-- Great Salary
-- Extremely visible role => CEO of that particular project
-- Lots of interactions
-- Safe from outsourcing

- CONS
-- Difficult to stay up to date
-- Difficult to get right
-- Can receive bad requirements => look over the shoulder of the Functional Analyst. Looks good on paper!!
-- First in line to receive blame
--- You can not screw up!!!
