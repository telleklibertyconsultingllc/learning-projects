# Designing a Software Architecture

## What is a Software Architecture

- Software architecture is a structured solution that meets all requirements and non-functional requirements, while optimizing common quality attributes such as performance, security and manageability.

- Requirements
-- User Requirements
--- How user interacts with the system
-- Business Requirements
--- Unique selling point
-- IT System Requirements
--- Technical requirements, such as "...system should be deployed in the cloud or on-premise"

## What composes an Architecture

- The structural elements and interfaces composing the system
- How these elements behave in collaboration
- The composition of elements into larger subsystems
- The architectural style that guides this composition

- Also covers functionality, usability, resilience, performance, reuse, comprehensibility, economic and technology constraints, tradeoffs and aesthetic concerns

## What are Software Architecture Goals

- Document high-level structure
- Do not go into implementation details
- Minimize complexity
- Address all requirements
- Be compatible with all use cases and scenarios

## Software Architecture Design Tips

- Build to change instead of building to last
- Use models, but only to analyze and reduce risk
- Use visualizations to communicate and collaborate
- Identify and research critical points of failure

## Key Principles of Software Architectures

- Software Architecture Goal
-- is to minimize complexity
-- This can be accomplished by separating the design into different areas of concerns
--- Make sure that each area has clearly, defined objectives

1 Separation of concerns
2 Single responsibility principle
3 Principle of least knowledge
4 Don't repeat yourself
5 Minimize upfront design

## Guidelines For Software Architectures

- How would the general guidelines look like
-- Use consistent patterns in each layer
-- Do not duplicate functionality
-- Prefer composition over inheritance (unless Business Logic Layer using OOP)
-- Establish a code convention

## Layer Guidelines

- Separate area of concern (Each layer has Presentation, Business and Data)
- Define communication between layers (Clearly define the communication between layers)
- Use abstraction to loosely couple layers
- Don't mix different types of components in a layer
- Use a consistent data format within a layer

## Guidelines for Components

- No component should rely on the internals of another
- Do not mix roles in a single components
- Define clear contracts for components
- Abstract system wide components away from other layers
